# my-tic-tac-toe

This is my little project, the aim of which is to use theoretical knowledge in practice.
This is a simple game in which you have to line up three symbols in a line before your opponent does.
"Player" has "X" symbol. Computer has "O" symbol.
Computer movements were based on a simple position number randomization function. 

## To start this game you need to download the code and open it as a project in the IDE (for example: IntelliJ IDEA).
